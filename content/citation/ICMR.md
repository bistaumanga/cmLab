### Stats:

* 5 years of publication 2011--2015, 423 papers total
* 4982 references total, average 11.78 per paper
	* 426 reference venues, 72.0% in top 25 
* 1066 citations total, average 2.52 per paper
	* 157 citations venues, 78.0% in top 25 
	* citation survival rates: 0yr 0.70; 10yr nan; 20yr nan 
 



The half-wheel on the left is a snapshot of the top venues that cites and cited by this venue (details in Figure 4 below). The survival graph on the right contains the fraction of papers cited at least X years after being published (details in Figure 10 below).

The plots on the rest of this page roughly breaks down into the following types. 

* Figure 1 - Figure 3 contains basic stats of papers, references and citations over its lifetime. 
* Figure 4 and 5 summarizes the incoming and outgoing citations over all years, sorted by the ratio of incoming over outgoing citations (left to right).
* Figure 5 and 6 breaks down the incoming and outgoing citations by year of the conference paper. 
* Figure 7 and 8 breaks down the outgoing references by the year they were cited in this conference. For most conferences we can see a 'google scholar' effect that older papers gets cited more (and from more venues) in recent years, likely due to the ease of finding them. 
* Figure 9-11 explores the question "how many papers are still cited at least after X years", and what fraction of papers are not cited at all.

Fig 4. Summary of incoming vs outgoing citations to the top-K venues. Node colors: ratio of citations (outgoing ideas, red) vs references (incoming ideas, blue). Node sizes: amount of total citation+references in either direction. Thickness of blue edges are scaled by the number of references going to a given venue; thickness of red edges are scaled by the number of citations coming from a given venue. Nodes are sorted left-to-right by the ratio of incoming vs outgoing citations to this conference.

Fig 5. Incoming vs outgoing citations to the top-K venues (this bar graph presents information from the half-circle differently). (blue) The number of references going to a given conference or journal; (red) The number of citations coming from a given conference or journal. The x-axis is sorted by the ratio of incoming vs outgoing citations to the conference, highest on the right.
