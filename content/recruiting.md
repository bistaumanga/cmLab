machine learning on graphs, <a href=https://hmi.anu.edu.au/>humanising machine intelligence</a>, and modeling online attention.
We have one PhD opening in 2019 on <a href=http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au/tags/popularity/>modeling online attention</a>.


**Q: What does the Computational Media lab look for in a candidate?**

A: We value curiosity, critical thinking, and diversity in ideas, skills, and cultural perspectives.

More specifically, candidates are expected to be strong in at least two of the following skills:

* Mathematical thinking;
* Computational thinking and the ability to prototype ideas against data;
* Research background in machine learning, optimisation, or one of the problem areas related to our lab.


**Q: What should I know about doing research / pursuing a PhD?**

A:

*You start graduate school with a vision of ''my dissertation: the movie'' and you end graduate school with ''my dissertation: the pretty good short story.''*
-- Anne Rogers to the New York Times, quoting David Touretzky. See http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E7DC1631F934A35753C1A9619C8B63

**Q: I'm an PhD/MS/undergradudate student and is interested in doing a postdoc / PhD.**

A: Research fellow and PhD positions are supported through various scholarships, research grants in a competitive basis. Drop us a line with your CV, representative publications, software project, or other evidence showing track record and potential. We will reply if there's a strong enough interest match.

**Q: I'm an undergradudate/MS student and would like to pursue research internship with you, is this possible?**

A: There are two ways to engage with us and try out research:

(1) The annual [summer research scholar program](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/summer-programs), applications due in August, research internship last between November and Feb. Similar programs are available through Data61, CSIRO and other local R&D organizations, their application timelines are similar, the process may be slightly different.

(2) Several ANU CS courses are solely/mainly focusing on a project, such as [COMP4560](http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/comp4560), [COMP8755](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/COMP8755) and a few others.

* If you are a current ANU student, you can apply for both (1) and (2).
* If you are a current student in another university in Australia or New Zealand, you can apply for (1).
* If you are currently outside of Australia or New Zealand, we regret that we _do not_ have the resource to bring people from overseas for a short stay. If you can fund your own stay, and still believe our lab and you are good fits to each other, then send an email listing the reasons.
